Hi everybody,

On December 16th 2018 with more than 25 locations world-wide the Global MR Bootcamp took place. Together with the Global AI Bootcamp this event became an incredible success. And that is done by the community. Something we are really proud off. And you should too! ðŸ˜Š 

Global MR Bootcamp keynote
We had a great keynote. With nobody less than Jess McCulloch, Program Manager at Microsoft around Mixed Reality for Windows and HoloLens, we had a great inspirational keynote! Be proud, be radical and be relentless!  The keynote which is shown in all those locations (and even some with local subtitles) can be found here;

The Global MR Bootcamp 2019
So keep a look out because we are going to repeat the Global MR Bootcamp again in 2019! And this time it is going to be bigger and better than ever. Since the combination of Mixed Reality and Artificial Intelligence is extremely powerful we have decided to expand the technologies even more! With 2019 in mind the event will be about Mixed, Augmented and X Reality, Machine Learning, AI, WebVR and WebXR. And every related technology which is bind to one of those will be allowed too.

We want to make this the biggest event ever in 2019!  And we will need your help for that! We know it is still far away, but we have setup a form to have an idea who wants to join the Global MR Bootcamp again. And we also love to hear your ideas.
